    - Add spaces around operators and after commas
    - Use proper indentation and line breaks for readability
    - Add spaces around operators and after commas
    - Align elements in nested functions
    - Break complex formulas into multiple lines with logical grouping
    - Separate logical sections with line breaks
    - Add // comments , and start the DAX code in the next line
    2. Explain how the measure works in detail
    3. Include comments in the DAX code to explain the logic
    4. Suggest where the measure could be used in visualizations
    5. When asked to follow patterns of a measure, stick to the same structure and naming conventions
